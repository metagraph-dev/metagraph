    This algorithm performs one step of the `Louvain algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_modularity>`_,
    which discovers communities by maximizing modularity.

    :rtype:

    :rtype: (parents, distance)


.. py:function:: traversal.minimum_spanning_tree(graph: Graph(is_directed=False, edge_type="map", edge_dtype={"int", "float"})) -> Graph

    Minimum spanning tree (or forest in the case of multiple connected components in the graph).

    :rtype: Graph containing only the relevant edges from the original graph

.. py:function:: traversal.astar_search(graph: Graph(edge_type="map", edge_dtype={"int", "float"}), source_node: NodeID, target_node: NodeID, heuristic_func: Callable[[NodeID], float]) -> Vector

    ``heuristic_func`` is a unary function that takes a node id and returns an estimated distance to ``target_node``.

    :rtype: Vector of node ids specifying the path from ``source_node`` to ``target_node``


Centrality
----------

Many algorithms assign a ranking or value to each vertex/node in the graph based on different properties. This is
usually done to find the most important nodes for that metric.


.. py:function:: centrality.betweenness(graph: Graph(edge_type="map", edge_dtype={"int", "float"}), nodes: Optional[NodeSet] = None, normalize: bool = False) -> NodeMap

    This algorithm calculates centrality based on the number of shortest paths passing through a node.

    If ``nodes`` are provided, only computes an approximation of betweenness centrality based on those nodes.


.. py:function:: centrality.katz(graph: Graph(edge_type="map", edge_dtype={"int", "float"}), attenuation_factor: float = 0.01, immediate_neighbor_weight: float = 1.0, maxiter: int = 50, tolerance: float = 1e-05) -> NodeMap

    This algorithm calculates centrality based on total number of walks (as opposed to only considering shortest paths)
    passing through a node.

    This algorithm determines the importance of a given node in the network based on links between important nodes.


.. py:function:: centrality.closeness(graph: Graph(edge_type="map", edge_dtype={"int", "float"}), nodes: Optional[NodeSet] = None) -> NodeMap

    Calculates the closeness centrality metric, which estimates the average distance from a node to all other nodes.
    A high closeness score indicates a small average distance to other nodes.

.. py:function:: centrality.eigenvector(graph: Graph(edge_type="map", edge_dtype={"int", "float"})) -> NodeMap

    Calculates the eigenvector centrality, which estimates the importance of a node in the graph.

.. py:function:: centrality.hits(graph: Graph(edge_type="map", edge_dtype={"int", "float"}), max_iter: int = 100, tol: float = 1e-05, normalize: bool = True) -> Tuple[NodeMap, NodeMap]

    :rtype: (hubs, authority)

.. py:function:: centrality.degree(graph: Graph, in_edges: bool = False, out_edges: bool = True) -> NodeMap

    Calculates the degree centrality for each node. The degree centrality for a node is its degree over the number of nodes minus 1.

    If ``in_edges`` and ``out_edges`` are both false, the degree centrality for all nodes is 0.
    If the graph is undirected, setting ``in_edges`` or ``out_edges`` or both to true will give identical results
    (edges will only be counted once per node).
    If the graph is directed, ``in_edges`` and ``out_edges`` dictate which edges are considered for each node. 


Subgraph
--------

Graphs are often too large to handle, so a portion of the graph is extracted. Often this subgraph must satisfy certain
properties or have properties similar to the original graph for the subsequent analysis to give good results.


.. py:function:: subgraph.extract_subgraph(graph: Graph, nodes: NodeSet) -> Graph

    Given a set of nodes, this algorithm extracts the subgraph containing those nodes and any edges between those nodes.


.. py:function:: subgraph.k_core(graph: Graph(is_directed=False), k: int) -> Graph

    This algorithm finds a maximal subgraph that contains nodes of at least degree ``k``.


.. py:function:: subgraph.k_truss(graph: Graph(is_directed=False), k: int) -> Graph

    Finds the maximal subgraph whose edges are supported by ``k`` - 2 other edges forming triangles.


.. py:function:: subgraph.maximal_independent_set(graph: Graph) -> NodeSet

    Finds a maximal set of independent nodes, meaning the nodes in the set share no edges with each other
    and no additional nodes in the graph can be added which satisfy this criteria.


.. py:function:: subgraph.subisomorphic(graph: Graph, subgraph: Graph) -> bool

    Indicates whether ``subgraph`` is an isomorphic subcomponent of ``graph``.


.. py:function:: subgraph.sample.node_sampling(graph: Graph, p: float = 0.20) -> Graph

    Returns a subgraph created by randomly sampling nodes and including edges which exist between sampled
    nodes in the original graph.


.. py:function:: subgraph.sample.edge_sampling(graph: Graph, p: float = 0.20) -> Graph

    Returns a subgraph created by randomly sampling edges and including both node endpoints.


.. py:function:: subgraph.sample.ties(graph: Graph, p: float = 0.20) -> Graph

    Totally Induced Edge Sampling extends edge sampling by also including any edges between the nodes
    which exist in the original graph. See the `paper <https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2743&context=cstech>`__
    for more details.


.. py:function:: subgraph.sample.random_walk(graph: Graph, num_steps: Optional[int] = None, num_nodes: Optional[int] = None, num_edges: Optional[int] = None, jump_probability: int = 0.15, start_node: Optional[NodeID] = None) -> Graph

    Samples the graph using a random walk. For each step, there is a ``jump_probability`` to reset the walk.
    When resetting the walk, if the ``start_node`` is specified, it always returns to this node. Otherwise a random
    node is chosen for each resetting. The sampling stops when any of ``num_steps``, ``num_nodes``, or ``num_edges`` is
    reached.



Bipartite
---------

Bipartite Graphs contain two unique sets of nodes. Edges can exist between nodes from different groups, but not between
nodes of the same group.

.. py:function:: bipartite.graph_projection(bgraph: BipartiteGraph, nodes_retained: int = 0) -> Graph

    Given a bipartite graph, project a graph for one of the two node groups (group 0 or 1).


Flow
----

.. py:function:: flow.max_flow(graph: Graph(edge_type="map", edge_dtype={"int", "float"}), source_node: NodeID, target_node: NodeID) -> Tuple[float, Graph]

    Compute the maximum flow possible from ``source_node`` to ``target_node``.

    :rtype: (max flow rate, computed flow graph)


.. py:function:: flow.min_cut(graph: Graph(edge_type="map", edge_dtype={"int", "float"}), source_node: NodeID, target_node: NodeID) -> Tuple[float, Graph]

    Compute the minimum cut to separate source from target node. This is the list of edges which disconnect the graph
    along edges with sum to the minimum weight.
    Performing this computation yields the maximum flow.

    :rtype: (max flow rate, graph containing cut edges)

    If ``in_edges`` and ``out_edges`` are False, each node will contain the initial value.

    (edges will only be counted once per node).
    For directed graphs, ``in_edges`` and ``out_edges`` affect the result. Setting both will still only give a single
    value per node, combining all outbound and inbound edge weights.

    If ``nodes`` are not provided, assume the only nodes are those found in the EdgeSet/Map.

.. py:function:: util.graph.collapse_by_label(graph: Graph(is_directed=False), labels: NodeMap, aggregator: Callable[[Any, Any], Any]) -> Graph
