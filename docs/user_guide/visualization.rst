Visualization
=============


One goal of metagraph is to abstract away backend implementation details.

For visualizations, the result is often dependent on the backend implementation, e.g. visualization libraries using different rendering methods may lead to different and possibly undesirable visual artifacts. 

Since such visual differences matter in visualizations, abstracting away backend implementations is non-trivial.

Determining how visualizations work within the metagraph workflow is an ongoing effort and open question. Thus, visualization functionality is not currently available in metagraph but is planned for the future.
