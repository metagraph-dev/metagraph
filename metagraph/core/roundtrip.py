        Verifies that all translators between objects of the same abstract type as `obj` are working correctly.

        The methodology is as follows:
        1. Find all types which are one-hop round-trippable
              Meaning there is a direct translation from `typeof(obj)` to `other_type` and also
              a direct translation from `other_type` back to `typeof(obj)`.
        2. Take `obj` through each one-hop round trip and verify the returned object is equivalent to `obj`
        3. Extend outward in a breadth-first search finding new one-hop translations from the current
              frontier of known good types. The idea is that a two-hop translation has more places which could
              introduce an error, but having checked the one-hop translations first, we can now isolate errors
              to the next ring of translators.
        4. Once all round-trippable steps have been taken for the breadth first search, find any translators
              that were not tested. See if there is a way to exercise the translator and arrive back to the
              starting object (i.e. a circular path). If so, make the translations and check equality.
        5. If any translators are not round-trippable (i.e. not strongly connected with `obj` in the
              translation graph), raise an error. Note that this does not apply to translators across abstract
              types, such as those allowed by unambiguous_subcomponents. Those translators should be exercised
              using `verify_one_way`.
